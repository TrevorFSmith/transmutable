Hey,

I just created an account for you on {{ site.name }}.  It's a simple app, but I'll be adding to it as time permits.  The concept is to create an elegant vessel for smarty-pants' work notes which is both a pleasure to use and interesting to others.

Head on over to http://{{ site.domain}}/ and hit the login link on the upper right.

Here is your username/password: {{user.username}}/{{password}}

Your {{ site.name }} "home" page provides a place to publish notes about what you're working on.  When you've completed something (big or small) there's a place to note that accomplishment.

Go crazy with it!  The one favor I ask is to give feedback, especially if there are features that make or break working in public for you. This is an experiment, so I'll be compiling observations about working in public (especially how others react to it) and I'd love to add your experiences.
